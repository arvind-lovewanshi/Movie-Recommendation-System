# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It provides personalized movie suggestions by analyzing movie descriptions and computing similarity scores.

### Features:
- **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates similarity between movies based on their descriptions.
- **Stemming:** Processes keywords to improve text matching and recommendation accuracy.
- **Top 5 Recommendations:** Suggests five movies similar to the selected one.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes a simple and intuitive website for users to select a movie and instantly view recommendations.

### Tech Stack:
- **Python**  
- **NLP Libraries:** `nltk`  
- **Machine Learning Concepts:** Cosine Similarity, Stemming  

### How It Works:
1. Users select a movie from the available list.  
2. The system analyzes the description of the selected movie and computes similarity scores with other movies using cosine similarity.  
3. Based on the scores, the top 5 most similar movies are recommended.
